                  Punisher is haunted by memory, by echoes, and sometimes by literal ghosts. I don’t know if either the song or the album is based on an actual friend Bridgers lost — the singer has always flirted with being a total goth — but it brims over with sadness, with regret, and with beauty. I don’t think there’s a single one of Punisher’s 11 songs that I haven’t become obsessed with and listened to over and over again at one point or another. (Album closer “I Know the End” is the one I’m obsessed with right now, thanks.)

                  What I love about Punisher is how it chronicles Bridgers’s discovery that the solution is often in the solidarity. These are songs about how hard it is to lose someone and to find that, in the process of mourning, you’ve shed some part of yourself like so much dead skin.

                  The cover of the album features Bridgers in a skeleton costume — a cheeky follow-up to the bedsheet ghost that adorned Stranger — but it’s more than a wink and a nod to Bridgers’s fascination with kindergarten Halloween iconography. Punisher is, at its core, about how often the best way forward is to strip yourself down to the bone and ask those you love if they still love you back. The answer is usually “yes,” and when someone else moves in to share that sorrow, that loss, that grief alongside you, the healing can begin.
